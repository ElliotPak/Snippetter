# Snippetter

Snippetter is a static website generation library for Haskell.

Snippetter is a **WORK IN PROGRESS**, and currently doesn't have all of its
functionality.

To read an **out of date** Snippetter tutorial, see
[docs/how-to-use.md](docs/how-to-use.md).

## Installation

At this stage, you probably shouldn't be using Snippetter, because things may
change wildly while I'm still figuring things out, but after cloning this
repository you can use Stack to install it like so:

```sh
stack update
stack install
```
